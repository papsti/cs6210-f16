\section{Logistics}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The midterm is due on Oct 17 at midnight.  There were some
  small clarifications and a typo fix; if you downloaded on Monday
  night, make sure you have the most recent version!
\item I will be away Oct 19, but am looking for an alternate lecturer.
  I will also not be holding office hours next week at the regular
  times (though can still make appointments).
\end{enumerate}
