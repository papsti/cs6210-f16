\section{Logistics}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item HW 2 problem 4 does {\em not} need a {\tt multA} argument;
    see Piazza post.
  \item There were some gaffes toward the end of Monday's lecture
    notes.  They are corrected now; please print a fresh copy if you
    like to keep paper copies of these things.
\end{enumerate}
