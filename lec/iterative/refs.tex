There is a lot of ground to cover when it comes to Krylov subspace
methods, and we scarcely have time to do justice to the two most popular
Krylov subspace methods (CG for the SPD case and GMRES elsewhere).
Apart from the material in Golub and Van Loan and other standard texts,
I highly recommend two books for a survey of other methods and some
practical details:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \href{http://www.netlib.org/templates/templates.pdf}{\em Templates for the Solution of Linear Systems:
Building Blocks for Iterative Methods}
  by Barrett {\em et al}.  This is freely available, and includes
  what you need to know to get started with various methods.
\item {\em Iterative methods for sparse linear systems} by Y.~Saad.
  This is now in a second edition (available from SIAM), but you
  can also get the first edition at \href{http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~saad/books.html}{Saad's web page}.
\item {\em Iterative methods for solving linear systems} by Anne Greenbaum
  (published by SIAM) is a fairly up-to-date treatment of the major iterative
  solvers for linear systems, including the whole family of Krylov subspace
  solvers as well as classical stationary iterations and multigrid methods.
\item {\em Iterative methods for linear and nonlinear equations} by C.~T.~Kelley
  is another SIAM book --- are you seeing a theme?
  It covers CG and GMRES, though not the other
  Krylov iterations; however, it also covers nonlinear iterations.  It is
  short and tutorial in nature.
\end{enumerate}
