\section{Methods for solving the 2D model problem}

Suppose we wanted to solve the 2D model problem in practice.  What
methods do we have at our disposal so far?  Of course, we have several
direct methods
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  We could run Gaussian elimination on $T_{n \times n}$.  This takes
  time $O(N^3)$, where $N = n^2$.
\item
  The matrix $T_{n \times n}$ is also a banded matrix with bandwidth
  $n$ so we could do band Gaussian elimination at a cost of
  $O(N^2 n) = O(N^{2.5})$.
\item
  A sparse direct solve using nested dissection ordering runs in
  $O(N^{1.5})$.
\item
  Treating the problem as a Sylvester equation and running
  Bartels-Stewart requires $O(n^3)$ time to find the eigensystem of
  $T$ and to transform $U$ and $F$ using the eigenvector matrix;
  and $O(n^2)$ time for the subsequent (diagonal) linear solve.
\item
  The eigenvector matrix for $T$ corresponds to a {\em discrete sine
    transform}, which is closely related to the FFT; and we know the
  eigenvalues in closed form.  This allows us to reduce the time for
  Bartels-Stewart to $O(n^2 \log n) = O(N \log N)$.
\end{enumerate}

In the coming lectures, we turn to a variety of {\em iterative methods}.
These methods do not produce an exact answer, but rather produce a
sequence of ever-better approximations to the truth.
With appropriate parameter choices,
the time to reduce the error by a constant factor scales
like\footnote{%

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
  Jacobi & $N^2$ \\
  Gauss-Seidel & $N^2$ \\
  CG & $N^{3/2}$ \\
  SOR & $N^{3/2}$ \\
  SSOR with Chebyshev acceleration & $N^{5/4}$ \\
  Multigrid & $N$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
For both the direct and iterative methods, the more structure we use,
the faster we can go.
