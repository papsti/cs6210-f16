\section{Minimax and interlacing}

The Rayleigh quotient is a building block for a great deal of theory.
One step beyond the basic characterization of eigenvalues as stationary
points of a Rayleigh quotient, we have
the {\em Courant-Fischer minimax theorem}:
\begin{theorem}
  If $\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \ldots \geq \lambda_n$, then
  we can characterize the eigenvalues via optimizations over
  subspaces $\calV$:
  \[
    \lambda_k
      = \max_{\dim \calV = k} \left( \min_{0 \neq v \in \calV} \rho_A(v) \right) \\
      = \min_{\dim \calV = n-k+1} \left( \max_{0 \neq v \in \calV} \rho_A(v) \right).
  \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Write $A = U \Lambda U^*$ where $U$ is a unitary matrix of eigenvectors.
  If $v$ is a unit vector, so is $x = U^* v$, and we have
  \[
    \rho_A(v) = x^* \Lambda x = \sum_{j=1}^n \lambda_j |x_j|^2,
  \]
  i.e. $\rho_A(v)$ is a weighted average of the eigenvalues
  of $A$.  If $\calV$ is a $k$-dimensional subspace, then we can find
  a unit vector $v \in \calV$ that satisfies the $k-1$ constraints
  $(U^* v)_j = 0$ for $j = 1$ through $k-1$ (i.e. $v$ is orthogonal to
  the invariant subspace associated with the first $k-1$
  eigenvectors).  For this $v$, $\rho_A(v)$ is a weighted average of
  $\lambda_k, \lambda_{k+1}, \ldots, \lambda_n$, so $\rho_A(v) \leq
  \lambda_k$.  Therefore,
  \[
      \max_{\dim \calV = k} \left( \min_{0 \neq v \in \calV} \rho_A(v) \right)
      \leq \lambda_k.
  \]
  Now, if $\calV$ is the range space of the first $k$ columns of $U$,
  then for any $v \in \calV$ we have that $\rho_A(v)$ is a weighted
  average of the first $k$ eigenvalues, which attains the minimal value
  $\lambda_k$ when we choose $v = u_k$.
\end{proof}

One piece of the minimax theorem is that given any $k$-dimensional subspace
$\calV$, the smallest value of the Rayleigh quotient over that
subspace is a {\em lower} bound on $\lambda_k$ and an {\em upper} bound
on $\lambda_{n-k+1}$.  Taking this one step further, we have the {\em Cauchy
interlace theorem}, which relates the eigenvalues of a block Rayleigh quotient
to the eigenvalues of the corresponding matrix.
\begin{theorem}
  Suppose $A$ is real symmetric (or Hermitian), and let $V$ be a
  matrix with $m$ orthonormal columns.  Then the eigenvalues of
  $W^* A W$ interlace the eigenvalues of $A$; that is, if $A$
  has eigenvalues $\alpha_1 \geq \alpha_2 \geq \ldots \geq \alpha_n$
  and $W^* A W$ has eigenvalues $\beta_j$, then
  \[
    \beta_j \in [\alpha_{n-m+j}, \alpha_j].
  \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $A \in \bbC^{n \times n}$ and $L \in \bbC^{m \times m}$.  The matrix
  $W$ maps $\bbC^{m}$ to $\bbC^{n}$, so for each $k$-dimensional subspace
  $\calV \subseteq \bbC^{m}$ there is a corresponding
  $k$-dimensional subspace of $W\calV \subseteq \bbC^{n}$.  Thus,
  \begin{align*}
  \beta_j &=
    \max_{\dim \calV = k} \left( \min_{0 \neq v \in \calV} \rho_L(v) \right)
  = \max_{\dim \calV = k} \left( \min_{0 \neq v \in W\calV} \rho_A(v) \right)
  \leq \alpha_k
  \end{align*}
  and similarly
  \begin{align*}
  \beta_j &=
    \min_{\dim \calV = m-k+1} \left( \max_{0 \neq v \in \calV} \rho_L(v) \right)
  =
    \min_{\dim \calV = m-k+1} \left( \max_{0 \neq v \in W\calV} \rho_A(v) \right) \\
  &=
    \min_{\dim \calV = n-(k+(n-m))+1} \left( \max_{0 \neq v \in W\calV} \rho_A(v) \right)
   \geq \alpha_{n-m+k}
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

Another application of the minimax theorem is due to Weyl:
if we write $\lambda_k(A)$ for the $k$th largest eigenvalue of
a symmetric $A$, then for any symmetric $A$ and $E$,
\[
  |\lambda_k(A+E)-\lambda_k(A)| \leq \|E\|_2.
\]
A related theorem is the Wielandt-Hoffman theorem:
\[
  \sum_{i=1}^n (\lambda_i(A+E)-\lambda_i(A))^2 \leq \|E\|_F^2.
\]
Both these theorems provide strong information about the spectrum
relative to what we have in the nonsymmetric case (e.g. from
Bauer-Fike).  Not only do we know that each eigenvalue of $A+E$ is
close to {\em some} eigenvalue of $A$, but we know that we can put the
eigenvalues of $A$ and $A+E$ into one-to-one correspondence.  So for
the eigenvalues in the symmetric case, small backward error implies
small forward error!

As an aside, note that if $\hat{v}$ is an approximate eigenvector and
$\hat{\lambda} = \rho_A(\hat{v})$ for a symmetric $A$, then we can
find an explicit form for a backward error $E$ such that
\[
  (A+E)\hat{v} = \hat{v}\hat{\lambda}.
\]
by evaluate the residual $r = Av-v\lambda$ and writing $E = rv^* + vr^*$.
So in the symmetric case, a small residual implies that we are near an
eigenvalue.  On the other hand, it says little about the corresponding
eigenvector, which may still be very sensitive to perturbations if
it is associated with an eigenvalue that is close to other eigenvalues.
