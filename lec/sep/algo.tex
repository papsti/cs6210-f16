\section{Algorithms}

There are several flavors of symmetric eigenvalue solvers for which
there is no equivalent (stable) nonsymmetric solver.  We discuss four
algorithmic ideas: the workhorse QR algorithm that we have already
seen, the Jacobi iteration, divide-and-conquer, and bisection with
inverse iteration.

The details of these algorithms are quite technical (particularly
the divide-and-conquer method and bisection with inverse iteration).
But even if you are not planning to focus in numerical linear algebra,
you should know a little about the shape of these algorithms.  Why?
Three reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item Intellectual fun!
\item To make an informed choice of algorithms.
\item To re-use building blocks.
\end{itemize}
