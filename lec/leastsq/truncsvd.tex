\section{Truncated SVD}

The Tikhonov filter reduces the effect of small singular values on
the solution, but it does not eliminate that effect.  By contrast,
the {\em truncated SVD} approach uses the filter
\[
f(z) =
\begin{cases}
  z, & z > \sigma_{\min} \\
  \infty, & \mbox{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]
In other words, in the truncated SVD approach, we use
\[
  x = V_k \Sigma_k^{-1} U_k^T b
\]
where $U_k$ and $V_k$ represent the leading $k$ columns of $U$ and
$V$, respectively, while $\Sigma_k$ is the diagonal matrix consisting
of the $k$ largest singular values.
