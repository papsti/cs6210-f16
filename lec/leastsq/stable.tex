\section{Stability of QR}

Last time, we discussed QR factorization via Householder reflectors
or Givens rotations.  It is not too difficult to
show that applying a Givens rotations or Householder reflector to
a matrix is backward-stable: if $P$ is the desired transformation,
the floating point result of $PA$ is
\[
  \tilde{P} A = (P+E) A, \quad \|E\| \leq O(\macheps) \|A\|.
\]
Moreover, orthogonal matrices are perfectly conditioned!
Taking a product of $j$ matrices is also fine; the result
has backward error bounded by $j O(\macheps) \|A\|$.
As a consequence, QR decomposition by Givens rotations or Householder
transformations is ultimately backward stable.

The stability of orthogonal matrices in general makes them a
marvelous building block for numerical linear algebra algorithms,
and we will take advantage of this again when we discuss
eigenvalue solvers.
