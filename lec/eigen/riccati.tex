\subsection{Riccati equations}

The Sylvester equation is a {\em linear} matrix equation whose solution
is accelerated via an intermediate eigendecomposition.  The
{\em algebraic Riccati equation} is a {\em quadratic} matrix equation
that also can be expressed via an eigenvalue problem.  The Riccati
equation occurs in optimal control problems, as well as some other places;
for the continuous-time optimal control problem, we would usually write
\[
  A^T X + XA - XBR^{-1} B^T X + Q = 0
\]
where $R$ and $Q$ are spd matrices representing cost functions,
$A$ and $B$ are general square matrices, and we seek a symmetric solution
matrix $X$.

The key to thinking of the Riccati equation via eigenvalues is to write
the left hand side of the equation as a pure quadratic:
\[
  \begin{bmatrix} I \\ X \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} Q & A \\ A^T & -BR^{-1}B^T \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} I \\ X \end{bmatrix} = 0.
\]
We can also characterize this by the relation
\[
  \begin{bmatrix} Q & A \\ A^T & -BR^{-1} B^T \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} I \\ X \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix} 0 & I \\ -I & 0 \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} I \\ X \end{bmatrix},
\]
or, equivalently
\[
  Z = \begin{bmatrix}
    A & -BR^{-1} B^T \\
    -Q & -A^T
  \end{bmatrix}, \quad Z 
  \begin{bmatrix} I \\ X \end{bmatrix} = 0.
\]
That is, we want a specific basis of the null space of
a {\em Hamiltonian matrix}, i.e. a matrix $Z$ such that
\[
  JZ \mbox{ symmetric}, J \equiv \begin{bmatrix} 0 & I \\ -I & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Hamiltonian eigenvalue problems show up in a surprising variety of
places in addition to optimal control. The theory of eigenvalue problems
for Hamiltonian and skew-Hamiltonian matrices is reasonably well
developed, and the eigenvalues have a special symmetry to them.  There
is now good software for these classes of problems that exploits the
structure --- though not in LAPACK.  The right place to look for these
solvers is in the SLICOT package.
