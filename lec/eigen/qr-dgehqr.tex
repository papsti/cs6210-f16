\section{The state of the art}

The current state of the art in QR iterations is the LAPACK code {\tt
  dgehqr} written by Ralph Byers, which is based on an award-winning
set of papers by Braman, Byers, and Mathias.  This code uses the following
general strategy:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Run the basic QR iteration to find the eigenvalues of a trailing $b \times b$
  submatrix.  Apply the transformations to the whole matrix, resulting in
  a ``spike'' to the left of the triangularized portion.
\item
  Look for converged eigenvalues in the trailing submatrix by analyzing
  the ``spike'' to find small elements.  Deflate any eigenvalues found
  (and there may be several).  This is called {\em aggressive early deflation}.
\item
  Use several of the remaining eigenvalues from the Rayleigh quotient block
  as a sequence of successive shifts.  These can be run simultaneously by
  chasing a sequence of closely-spaced bulges down the main diagonal.
  The similarity transformations associated are applied in a blocky way
  to get good cache performance.
\end{enumerate}
