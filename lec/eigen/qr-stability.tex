\section{Stability of the method}

Each step of the implicitly double-shifted QR iteration changes the
matrix only with orthogonal transformations (which are perfectly conditioned)
or deflations.  Hence, the QR iteration is backward stable.  However,
this is {\em not} the same as saying that the method is forward stable!
For forward stability, the conditioning of the eigenvalues is critical,
and multiple (or nearly multiple) eigenvalues of multiplicity $m$
usually inherit an $O(\epsilon^{1/m})$ error, as we saw in our earlier
discussion of sensitivity.

The intermediate computations in the QR code as given above are prone to
scaling problems, and so the basic QR codes in LAPACK ({\tt dlahqr})
uses a more careful construction of a scaled copy of the first Householder
transformation.
