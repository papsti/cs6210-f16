\section{Basic LU factorization}

Let's generalize our previous algorithm and write a simple code for
$LU$ factorization.  We will leave the issue of pivoting to a later
discussion.  We'll start with a purely loop-based implementation:
\begin{lstlisting}
%
% Overwrites A with an upper triangular factor U, keeping track of
% multipliers in the matrix L.
%
function [L,A] = mylu(A)

  n = length(A);
  L = eye(n);
  for j=1:n-1
    for i=j+1:n

      % Figure out multiple of row j to subtract from row i
      L(i,j) = A(i,j)/A(j,j);

      % Subtract off the appropriate multiple
      A(i,j) = 0
      for k=j+1:n
        A(i,k) = A(i,k) - L(i,j)*A(j,k);
      end
    end
  end
\end{lstlisting}
Note that we can write the two innermost loops more concisely by
thinking of them in terms of applying a {\em Gauss
  transformation} $M_j = I - \tau_j e_j^T$, where $\tau_j$ is the
vector of multipliers that appear when eliminating in column $j$:
\begin{lstlisting}
%
% Overwrites A with an upper triangular factor U, keeping track of
% multipliers in the matrix L.
%
function [L,A] = mylu(A)

  n = length(A);
  L = eye(n);
  for j=1:n-1

    % Form vector of multipliers
    L(j+1:n,j) = A(j+1:n,j)/A(j,j);

    % Apply Gauss transformation
    A(j+1:n,j) = 0;
    A(j+1:n,j+1:n) = A(j+1:n,j+1:n)-L(j+1:n,j)*A(j,j+1:n);

  end
\end{lstlisting}
