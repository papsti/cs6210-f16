\section{Triangular solves}

Suppose that we have computed a factorization $PA = LU$.  How can we
use this to solve a linear system of the form $Ax = b$?  Permuting the
rows of $A$ and $b$, we have
\[
  PAx = LUx = Pb,
\]
and therefore
\[
  x = U^{-1} L^{-1} Pb.
\]
So we can reduce the problem of finding $x$ to two simpler problems:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Solve $Ly = Pb$
\item
  Solve $Ux = y$
\end{enumerate}
We assume the matrix $L$ is unit lower triangular (diagonal of all
ones + lower triangular), and $U$ is upper triangular, so we can solve
linear systems with $L$ and $U$ involving forward and backward
substitution.

As a concrete example, suppose
\[
  L = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 \\
        2 & 1 & 0 \\
        3 & 2 & 1
      \end{bmatrix}, \quad
  d = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}
\]
To solve a linear system of the form $Ly = d$, we process each row in
turn to find the value of the corresponding entry of $y$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Row 1:
  $y_1 = d_1$
\item Row 2: $2y_1 + y_2 = d_2$, or $y_2 = d_2 - 2y_1$
\item Row 3: $3y_1 + 2 y_2 + y_3 = d_3$, or $y_3 = d_3 - 3y_1 - 2y_2$
\end{enumerate}
More generally, the {\em forward substitution} algorithm for solving
unit lower triangular linear systems $Ly = d$ looks like
\begin{lstlisting}
  y = d;
  for i=2:n
    y(i) = d(i)-L(1:i-1)*y(1:i-1)
  end
\end{lstlisting}
Similarly, there is a {\em backward substitution} algorithm for
solving upper triangular linear systems $Ux = d$
\begin{lstlisting}
  x(n) = d(n)/U(n,n);
  for i=n-1:-1:1
    x(i) = ( d(i)-U(i+1:n)*x(i+1:n) )/U(i,i)
  end
\end{lstlisting}
Each of these algorithms takes $O(n^2)$ time.
