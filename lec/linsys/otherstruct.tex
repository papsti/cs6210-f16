\section{Other structures}

Are these the only structures that we can use for fast linear solves?
Of course they are not.  For any data sparse matrix, there is at least
the hope of a fast direct solver, whether it is based on Gaussian
elimination or some other approach.  But in many cases, it is not
as straightforward to come up with a fast linear solver as to come
up with a fast multiplication routine.

If you are faced with an unfamiliar structured matrix and want to
devise a fast solver, then, what is my best advice?  First, figure
out the name of the structure!  Then you can start searching to see
whether someone else has already devised a fast solver.  And if you
come up with a new idea, knowing the name of the structure you have
used increases the likelihood that your work may be re-used by
someone else.
