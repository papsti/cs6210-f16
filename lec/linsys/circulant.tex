\section{Circulant matrices}

We previously discussed fast {\em multiply} routines for circulant,
Toeplitz, and Hankel matrices.  The building block
to compute $y = Cx$ where $C$ is the circulant matrix with leading
column $c$ is to use the FFT to reduce the problem to diagonal form.
If $Z$ is the FFT matrix, we have
\[
  y = Cx = Z^{-1} \ddiag(\tilde{c}) Z x
\]
where $\tilde{c} = Zc$ is the FFT of $c$.  In code, we have
\begin{lstlisting}
y = ifft(fft(c) .* fft(x));
\end{lstlisting}
To solve a circulant system, we invert each of the linear operations
involved, i.e.
\[
  x = Z^{-1} \ddiag(\tilde{c})^{-1} Zy
\]
which we can implement in code as
\begin{lstlisting}
x = ifft(fft(y) ./ fft(c));
\end{lstlisting}
What if we wanted to solve a Toeplitz or a Hankel matrix?  There are
indeed fast Toeplitz and Hankel solvers, but they are much more subtle
than two Fourier transforms and a scaling.
