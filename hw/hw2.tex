\hdr{HW 2}

You may (and should) talk about problems with each other and with me,
providing attribution for any good ideas you might get.  Your final
write-up should be your own.

\paragraph*{1: Entrywise errors}
Suppose $Ax = b$ and $\hat{x} = x + e$ satisfies
\[
  A \hat{x} = b + r.
\]
Suppose we are given an elementwise relative residual bound
$\max_i |r_i|/|b_i| < \gamma$; then show that
\[
  \max_i |e_i|/|x_i| \leq
  \gamma \|\ddiag(x)^{-1} A^{-1} \ddiag(b)\|_\infty.
\]

\paragraph*{2: Delicious differentials}
Suppose $PA = LU$, and assume that there are no ties during partial
pivoting.  Write a short \matlab\ routine to compute the variations
$\delta L$ and $\delta U$ for a given change $\delta A$
\begin{lstlisting}
  function [dL, dU] = hw2deriv(L, U, P, dA)
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph*{3: Complementary conditioning}
Suppose $A$ is symmetric and positive definite.  Show that if $S$
is a Schur complement that appears during factorization of $A$,
then $\kappa_2(S) \leq \kappa_2(A)$.  {\em Hint:} What is the
relation between $\kappa_2(A)$ and $\kappa_2(L)$ where $A = LL^T$
is a Cholesky factorization?  What is the relation between the
Cholesky factorization of $A$ and of $S$?

\paragraph*{4: Run for the border}
Suppose $A$ satisfies
\[
  \sigma_1(A) \leq C \sigma_{n-1}(A)
\]
for some modest $C$, but $\sigma_n(A)$ is very close to zero,
and let {\tt solveA} be a backward stable function for solving
a linear system involving the matrix $A$.  Assuming the bordered
system
\[
  \begin{bmatrix} A & b \\ c^T & d \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix} f \\ g \end{bmatrix}
\]
is well conditioned.  Write a \matlab\ code that uses
block Gaussian elimination based with one
step of iterative refinement to solve the system:
\begin{lstlisting}
  function [x, y] = hw2refine(solveA, b, c, d, f, g)
\end{lstlisting}
Argue that this computation is backward stable.
